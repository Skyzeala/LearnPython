# Hello world is every programmers first program, and in Python this single line is how you do it.

print("Hello, World!") #Your first code!

# Comments in Python are started with "#", anything written after this symbol will get ignored

# 'print()' is a function to send output to the console, here it takes a string argument '"Hello, World!"' 
# Try changing the text to a different phrase
