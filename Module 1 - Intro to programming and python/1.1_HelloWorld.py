# Hello world is every programmers first program, and in Python this single line is how you do it.

# Lines that start with '#' are comments. They don't affect the program, but can provide useful insights.

# 'print()' is a function to send output to the console, here it takes a string argument '"Hello, World!"' 

print("Hello, World!")
