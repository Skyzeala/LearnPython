# Welcome to Python!

This tutorial was written with the goal of being accessible to people without coding experience. A few friends of mine wanted to learn about coding, so I decided to put together this tutorial. Their goals and interests are in data science, visual tools, and games. The tutorials will start to lean into that after the basics have been established.

# How to use this tutorial

This tutorial is designed to be an easy quick reference for new coders. The script files are intentionally short to keep each concept concise and easy to navigate. Each module has one main topic, and may be dependent on prior modules' learning. Learners are encouraged to not just look at and run the code, but modify it and write new code.
