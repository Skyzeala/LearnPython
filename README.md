# Welcome to Python!

This tutorial was written with the goal of being accessible to people without coding experience. Each module has one main topic, and may be dependent on prior modules' learning. This tutorial was designed for a few friends of mine. Their goals and interests are in data science, visual tools, and games. The tutorials will start to lean into that after the basics have been established.

If you need help getting started, check out the [tools_tutorial.md](tools_tutorial.md) file!
